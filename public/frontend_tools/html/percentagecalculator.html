            <h4>How do I use this percentage calculator?</h4>

            <p>
                The first calculator calculates what a certain percentage of an amount is. For example: What is 12% of
                50? Answer: 6, because 12 percent of 50 is 6.<br/>
                The second calculator calculates how much percent an amount is of another amount. For example: 20 is
                what percent of 10? Answer: 200%, because 20 is 200 percent of 10.<br/>
                The third calculator calculates what the total amount is if a certain amount is a certain percentage of
                that. Example: 20 is 50% of what? Answer: 40, because 20 is 50 percent of 40.<br/>
                The fourth calculator calculates what the percentage increase or decrease from one amount to another is.
                Example: What is the percentage increase or decrease from 50 to 60? Answer: 20%, because 50 to 60 is a
                20 percent increase.
                The percent value is computed by multiplying the numeric value of the ratio by 100. For example, to find
                50 apples as a percentage of 1250 apples, first compute the ratio 50/1250 = 0.04, and then multiply by
                100 to obtain 4%. The percent value can also be found by multiplying first, so in this example the 50
                would be multiplied by 100 to give 5,000, and this result would be divided by 1250 to give 4%.

                To calculate a percentage of a percentage, convert both percentages to fractions of 100, or to decimals,
                and multiply them. For example, 50% of 40% is:

                (50/100) * (40/100) = 0.50 * 0.40 = 0.20 = 20/100 = 20%.
                It is not correct to divide by 100 and use the percent sign at the same time. (E.g. 25% = 25/100 = 0.25,
                not 25% / 100, which actually is (25/100) / 100 = 0.0025. A term such as (100/100)% would also be
                incorrect, this would be read as (1) percent even if the intent was to say 100%.)

                Whenever we talk about a percentage, it is important to specify what it is relative to, i.e. what is the
                total that corresponds to 100%. The following problem illustrates this point.

                In a certain college 60% of all students are female, and 10% of all students are computer science
                majors. If 5% of female students are computer science majors, what percentage of computer science majors
                are female?
                We are asked to compute the ratio of female computer science majors to all computer science majors. We
                know that 60% of all students are female, and among these 5% are computer science majors, so we conclude
                that (60/100) * (5/100) = 3/100 or 3% of all students are female computer science majors. Dividing this
                by the 10% of all students that are computer science majors, we arrive at the answer: 3%/10% = 30/100 or
                30% of all computer science majors are female.

            <p>
                This calculator helps you to solve numerous problems involving percentages. It can calculate percentage
                growth, reverse percentage, and many more. It can be used for taxes, weight, discounts etc.
                If you dont have the time to figure out what the right way to calculate something involving percentages
                is, or simply dont know how to calculate percentage, this tool is the right choice for you and helps
                you identify and solve those problems in an easy-to-understand way.

                Sometimes due to inconsistent usage, it is not always clear from the context what a percentage is
                relative to. When speaking of a "10% rise" or a "10% fall" in a quantity, the usual interpretation is
                that this is relative to the initial value of that quantity. For example, if an item is initially priced
                at $200 and the price rises 10% (an increase of $20), the new price will be $220. Note that this final
                price is 110% of the initial price (100% + 10% = 110%).

                Some other examples of percent changes:

                An increase of 100% in a quantity means that the final amount is 200% of the initial amount (100% of
                initial + 100% of increase = 200% of initial); in other words, the quantity has doubled.
                An increase of 800% means the final amount is 9 times the original (100% + 800% = 900% = 9 times as
                large).
                A decrease of 60% means the final amount is 40% of the original (100% ? 60% = 40%).
                A decrease of 100% means the final amount is zero (100% ? 100% = 0%).
                In general, a change of x percent in a quantity results in a final amount that is 100+x percent of the
                original amount (equivalently, 1+0.01x times the original amount).

            <h4>About percentages</h4>

            <p>
                In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted
                using the percent sign, "%", other than promill, or millage, which expresses a fraction of 1000.<br/>
                The term "per cent" is derived from the Latin per centum, meaning "by the hundred".
                The sign for "per cent" evolved by gradual contraction of the Italian term per cento, meaning "for a
                hundred".
                The "per" was often abbreviated as "p." and eventually disappeared entirely. The "cento" was contracted
                to two circles separated by a horizontal line, from which the modern "%" symbol is derived.<br/>
                Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_(mathematics)">Wikipedia</a>

                In British English, percent is sometimes written as two words (per cent, although percentage and
                percentile are written as one word). In American English, percent is the most common variant (but
                cf. per mille written as two words).

                In the early part of the twentieth century, there was a dotted abbreviation form "per cent.", as opposed
                to "per cent". The form "per cent." is still in use as a part of the highly formal language found in
                certain documents like commercial loan agreements (particularly those subject to, or inspired by, common
                law), as well as in the Hansard transcripts of British Parliamentary proceedings. The term has been
                attributed to Latin per centum. The concept of considering values as parts of a hundred is originally
                Greek. The symbol for percent (%) evolved from a symbol abbreviating the Italian per cento. In some
                other languages, the form prosent is used instead. Some languages use both a word derived from percent
                and an expression in that language meaning the same thing, e.g. Romanian procent and la sut? (thus, 10 %
                can be read or sometimes written ten for [each] hundred, similarly with the English one out of ten).
                Other abbreviations are rarer, but sometimes seen.

                Grammar and style guides often differ as to how percentages are to be written. For instance, it is
                commonly suggested that the word percent (or per cent) be spelled out in all texts, as in "1 percent"
                and not "1%". Other guides prefer the word to be written out in humanistic texts, but the symbol to be
                used in scientific texts. Most guides agree that they always be written with a numeral, as in "5
                percent" and not "five percent", the only exception being at the beginning of a sentence: "Ten percent
                of all writers love style guides." Decimals are also to be used instead of fractions, as in "3.5 percent
                of the gain" and not "3.5 percent of the gain". It is also widely accepted to use the percent symbol (%)
                in tabular and graphic material.

                In line with common English practice, style guides - such as The Chicago Manual of Style - generally state
                that the number and percent sign are written without any space in between. However, the International
                System of Units and the ISO 31-0 standard require a space.
