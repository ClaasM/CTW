        <h4>How do I use this multiplication calculator?</h4>

        <p>
            Enter two factors and click calculate to multiply the two numbers.<br/>
            Click clear to clear the two input fields.
            The multiplication of integers (including negative numbers), rational numbers (fractions) and real numbers
            is defined by a systematic generalization of this basic definition.
            Multiplication can also be visualized as counting objects arranged in a rectangle (for whole numbers) or as
            finding the area of a rectangle whose sides have given lengths. The area of a rectangle does not depend on
            which side is measured first, which illustrates the commutative property.
            The inverse operation of the multiplication is the division. For example, since 4 multiplied by 3 equals 12,
            then 12 divided by 3 equals 4. Multiplication by 3, followed by division by 3, yields the original number
            (since the division of a number other than 0 by itself equals 1).
            Multiplication is also defined for other types of numbers, such as complex numbers, and more abstract
            constructs, like matrices. For these more abstract constructs, the order that the operands are multiplied
            sometimes does matter.

        <h4>About this calculator</h4>

        <p>
            With this multiplier (or multiplication calculator) you can calculate integers and decimals, positive and
            negative.
            The common methods for multiplying numbers using pencil and paper require a multiplication table of
            memorized or consulted products of small numbers (typically any two numbers from 0 to 9), however one
            method, the peasant multiplication algorithm, does not.
            Multiplying numbers to more than a couple of decimal places by hand is tedious and error prone. Common
            logarithms were invented to simplify such calculations. The slide rule allowed numbers to be quickly
            multiplied to about three places of accuracy. Beginning in the early twentieth century, mechanical
            calculators, such as the Marchant, automated multiplication of up to 10 digit numbers. Modern electronic
            computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication by hand.

        <h4>About multiplication</h4>

        <p>
            When two measurements are multiplied together the product is of a type depending on the types of the
            measurements. The general theory is given by dimensional analysis. This analysis is routinely applied in
            physics but has also found applications in finance. One can only meaningfully add or subtract quantities of
            the same type but can multiply or divide quantities of different types.
            A common example is multiplying speed by time gives distance, so
            50 kilometers per hour * 3 hours = 150 kilometers.
