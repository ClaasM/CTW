        <h4>How do I use this calculator?</h4>

        <p>
            This body mass index calculator works for women, men, teens and kids alike, since the formula stays the same
            for all of them.<br/>
            If the person who's BMI is calculated is 11 or younger, no recommendation regarding weight loss or gain is
            made since kids tend to have a lot of variation in their BMI without actually being obese or
            underweight<br/>
            For more information about a healthy weight for chilren please visit the <a
                href="http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/bmi_for_age/en/">WHO Website.</a><br/>
            If you live in the UK, USA or any other country that doesn't use the metric system you can switch to the
            imperial system using the link on the top.<br/>
            BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measurement of body fat based on height and weight that applies to both men and
            women between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

            BMI can be used to indicate if you are overweight, obese, underweight or normal. A healthy BMI score is
            between 20 and 25. A score below 20 indicates that you may be underweight; a value above 25 indicates that
            you may be overweight.

            You can calculate your BMI by using our BMI Calculator below, or by using the BMI Formula.

            Please remember, however, that this is only one of many possible ways to assess your weight. If you have any
            concerns about your weight, please discuss them with your physician, who is in a position, unlike this BMI
            calculator, to address your specific individual situation.

        <h4>What is the BMI?</h4>

        <p>
            The BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.<br/>
            The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height (m / l<sup>2</sup>), and is
            universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.<br/>
            The BMI may also be determined using a table[note 2] or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and
            height using contour lines or colors for different BMI categories, and may use two different units of
            measurement.[note 3]
            The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and
            then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value.
            However, there is some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be
            placed.[2] Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight:
            25 to 30, obese: over 30.
            There are criticisms of using the BMI to define obesity in individuals.[3] One is that the BMI was designed
            for population studies, not individuals. Another is that body fat percentage (BFP) is a more reliable
            indicator of obesity than BMI: very muscular, lean (low body fat) individuals can be classified as obese
            using BMI, but are classified as having a normal weight using BFP. An even simpler alternative to the BMI is
            to define obese individuals as those whose waist circumference is greater than 50% of their height,
            indicating excess intra-abdominal fat.

        <h4>Is my BMI healthy?</h4>

        <p>
            Commonly accepted BMI ranges are: <br/>
            underweight: under 18.5, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30.
            YourCalculator.com is not a health advisor. If you are obese or underweight, please visit a doctor for
            medical advice.
            The medical establishment and statistical community have both highlighted the limitations of BMI.
            Mathematician Keith Devlin and the restaurant industry association Center for Consumer Freedom argue that
            the error in the BMI is significant and so pervasive that it is not generally useful in evaluation of
            health. University of Chicago political science professor Eric Oliver says BMI is a convenient but
            inaccurate measure of weight, forced onto the populace, and should be revised.
