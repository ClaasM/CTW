        <h4>How do I use this loan calculator?</h4>

        <p>
            Enter the amount of your loan or mortgage, the annual interest rate in percent and the loan term in years or
            months and click calculate. <br/>
            The loan calculator will then show you the monthly payment, the total amount paid and how much of the total
            amount is interest (In your currency and in percent).
            Use this car payment calculator to estimate monthly payments on your next new or used auto loan. Simply
            enter the loan amount, term and interest rate to calculate your monthly auto loan payments. This calculator
            will help you determine how much car you can afford.
            Consumers generally seek loans out of financial need, or because they want to acquire something: A car, a
            vacation, an extension to the home. Loans of this type are quite different from mortgages which finance
            house purchases.
            What characterizes most consumer lending is that it is intended to be relatively short-term. It rarely
            extends for more than ten years. It may take many different forms: Credit card purchases are a form of
            consumer loan, even if the consumer pays the purchase back at the end of the month. Short-term loans to help
            cover bill payments, or even the so-called 'paycheck' loans made just to cover a consumer's salary payment
            are all forms of consumer lending.
            There are two basic kinds of consumer loans: Secured and Unsecured.
            A secured loan means that the consumer has put up some form of property in exchange for the money. You might
            go to a bank, and offer a valuable coin collection up as collateral for a secured loan that permits you to
            buy a small boat that you wanted. You could, of course, sell your coin collection to get the money, but then
            you wouldn't have it anymore. By putting it up as collateral, you get to keep it so long as you pay the
            installments on the loan. Of course, you pay interest on the loan as well.
            When you take out an unsecured loan, you simply sign an agreement to pay the loan back. There is no
            collateral, no property that belongs to you to guarantee repayment. You can obtain a personal loan that
            unsecured, but there are others that we obtain relatively easily like credit cards and overdrafts. It is
            quite difficult to obtain a personal loan on an unsecured basis. One must have an excellent credit rating to
            qualify, and, often, banks will only consider longstanding clients for such loans.

            A loan is a contract between a borrower and a lender in which the borrower receives an amount of money
            (principal) which he is obligated to pay back later. Thousands of loans have been invented since its
            creation. By the way of payback, most loans can be categorized into the following.

            A loan is a contract between a borrower and a lender in which the borrower receives an amount of money
            (principal) which he is obligated to pay back later. Thousands of loans have been invented since its
            creation. By the way of payback, most loans can be categorized into the following:
            Pay back a fixed amount periodically, until it matures.
            Pay back altogether in the end
            Pay back a fixed amount (the face value for bond) in the end
            The following calculators address these three categories. We also have specialized mortgage calculator, auto
            loan calculator, and lease calculator.
            An interest rate is the percentage of money paid by a borrower to the lender for the use of money. For most
            loans, the interest is added to the principal so that the interest that has been added also earns interest.
            Normally loan interest was expressed in APR, which is the interest rate compounded monthly. The normal rate
            published by banks or APY is the interest rate compounded annually.
            Loan Basics for Consumers
            Consumers generally seek loans out of financial need, or because they want to acquire something: A car, a
            vacation, an extension to the home. Loans of this type are quite different from mortgages which finance
            house purchases.
            What characterizes most consumer lending is that it is intended to be relatively short-term. It rarely
            extends for more than ten years. It may take many different forms: Credit card purchases are a form of
            consumer loan, even if the consumer pays the purchase back at the end of the month. Short-term loans to help
            cover bill payments, or even the so-called 'paycheck' loans made just to cover a consumer's salary payment
            are all forms of consumer lending.
            There are two basic kinds of consumer loans: Secured and Unsecured.
            A secured loan means that the consumer has put up some form of property in exchange for the money. You might
            go to a bank, and offer a valuable coin collection up as collateral for a secured loan that permits you to
            buy a small boat that you wanted. You could, of course, sell your coin collection to get the money, but then

            installments on the loan. Of course, you pay interest on the loan as well.
            When you take out an unsecured loan, you simply sign an agreement to pay the loan back. There is no
            collateral, no property that belongs to you to guarantee repayment. You can obtain a personal loan that

            quite difficult to obtain a personal loan on an unsecured basis. One must have an excellent credit rating to
            qualify, and, often, banks will only consider longstanding clients for such loans.
            For whatever kind of loan you borrow, you will have to pay interest. Interest is the profit that the bank or
            lender makes on loan – what it earns for doing business with you.
            When you take out a loan, it's important to calculate how much interest you will have to pay on it, based on
            the rate of interest that the lender is charging you. Add up your interest payments to get the cost of the
            loan (along with any charges that the bank may impose).
            If you seek a loan for your business, much will depend on the credit rating your business has and the length
            of time it's been up and running. An established business, one that works regularly with a bank, may have no
            trouble at all getting a loan. A startup, or a small business can, on the other hand, find that getting
            access to credit is a real struggle. If getting a loan proves difficult, continued shopping for banks or
            alternative providers is the best route for a business.
            Commercial loans are often made on the basis that the principal is repaid in full at the end of the life of
            the loan, while interest is paid throughout. Loan Calculator Two covers this kind of loan.
            Whether you borrow for yourself, or for your business, there are essentially three types of loans you can
            make, and the loan calculators can show you how to determine the costs.
